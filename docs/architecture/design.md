# Design Document

## Overview

The Event Planner Platform DevOps Infrastructure is designed as a cloud-native, multi-tier architecture on AWS that supports separate frontend and backend repositories with automated CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive monitoring, and enterprise-grade security. The design emphasizes scalability, reliability, and cost optimization while providing the foundation for real-time collaboration features and third-party integrations.

The architecture follows AWS Well-Architected Framework principles across five pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization.

### Network Architecture

The infrastructure uses a multi-AZ VPC design with public and private subnets:

- **Public Subnets**: NAT Gateways, Application Load Balancers
- **Private Subnets**: ECS Services, RDS instances, ElastiCache
- **Database Subnets**: Isolated subnets for RDS with no internet access
- **Security Groups**: Least-privilege access controls between tiers

### Multi-Environment Strategy

Each environment (dev, staging, production) is deployed in separate AWS accounts for complete isolation:

- **Development**: Single AZ, smaller instance sizes, shared resources, automated scaling down during idle periods
- **Staging**: Multi-AZ, production-like configuration, blue-green deployments, automated testing validation
- **Production**: Multi-AZ, auto-scaling, high availability, disaster recovery, comprehensive monitoring

**Environment Configuration Management**
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) with environment-specific variable files
- Parameterized configurations for environment-specific settings
- Automated configuration drift detection using AWS Config
- Standardized environment provisioning templates
- Consistent security policies across all environments
